<h2><u> 1. Virtual Learning Experience </u> </h2>
<h4> Our institution understands the need of the students and acknowledges their quest for learning more. 
     Hence we have established EduComp set ups in each and every class, so that every student experiences 
     learning at its best.</h4>

<h2><u> 2. Focusing on Co-curricular activities</u></h2>
<h4> At liberty high we accept the fact that each student is diiferent and that each of their indivisuality 
     needs to be celebrated. Thus we not only promote academics but aslo take care that the students flourish 
     in cocurriculars such as Dancing, Singing, Art and Crafts.</h4>
